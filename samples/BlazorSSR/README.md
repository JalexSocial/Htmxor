# Blazor SSR idiomatic sample

The purpose of this sample is to show how to use Blazor SSR in an idiomatic way to implement the "Contact APP" solution. This should give us an idea of how this solutions compares to the HTMX enaled ones.

## Notes:

- The `contacts.json` file is not ignored by the GIT, but still included. To toggle this behavior:
   
  Disable tracking: `git update-index --skip-worktree contacts.json`
  Enable tracking: `git update-index --no-skip-worktree contacts.json`
